# Frog crossy River
This is a game about a frog who wants to cross the river, but the frog cannot touch the river but it only can go through the woods in order to reach its destination.

# Instructions:
NB: our tasks should be due this wednesday, but at least this Saturday
The reason for this is that we are still going to check everything and also a vote between classmates will be done next week for the best game between us.

Every task should be testable and add your constants in the constants.py, test your code before pushing then. I have already added the preliminary codes. Thank you in advance. If you have suggestions, post in the slack chat. 

And it should respect the deadline, but inform the team members if you can't reach on time so that the others can help you to catch up. Thank you.
